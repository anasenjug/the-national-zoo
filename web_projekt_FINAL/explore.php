            Established in 1973, our zoo has a rich and storied history

            conservation efforts and promoting education about biodiversity.
            Our journey began with a vision to create a space where people of all ages could connect with nature, learn about endangered species, and understand the importance of preserving natural habitats. Through tireless dedication and unwavering commitment, our zoo has grown into a thriving ecosystem that houses a diverse array of animals while remaining steadfast in our conservation ethos.
